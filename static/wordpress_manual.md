# RASL Publications WP Manual

This is a short manual for the RASL Publications CMS - a version of Wordpress. Meant for editors. :)

# Menu
We'll quickly get into each item of the Wordpress menu. For more detailed help on filling in a post, see the below [video's](video).

## Featured

On the frontend website, *Featured Posts* show up in the slideshow. They always require a featured image.
Featured posts are actually selected from the three other categories of posts, to create a post go there:

 - General/Intros
 - Practice
 - Reflective

Then return to 'Featured' and simply select your post from the drop-down menu and click **Publish**. The post will now be featured on the front page.

## General/Intros

These are posts (articles, videos, podcasts) that cannot be defined by Practice or Reflective. They will not be shown on the website, unless also selected under 'Featured'.

See the next tab 'Practice and Reflective' for more info on creating a post.

## Practice and Reflective

We've seperated 'Practice' and 'Reflective' into two menu items, but the tabs are otherwise identical.
This is where you add a new post (**Add New**), delete a post (mouse-over and select **Trash**) or edit a post (mouse-over and select **Edit**).

Inside a new post, the column on the right side gives you more options: this is where you change the status of the post (from *Draft* to *Published* for example), add tags and content types and select the authors.

For more help on adding content to a post, see the below video:

### Tags
Inside a post, you can add a tag simply by typing it in the text field and clicking **Add**. It's important to be consistent in spelling and style. The CMS will also make a suggestion based on 'most used'. 

The menu on the left side has a 'Tags' tab, where you have an overview of all the tags in use. This is also where you can edit the names, add descriptions or even **Add** a new one. The overview takes into account all posts, not just Reflective or Practice.


### Content Types
Works just as the tags, although we would restrict the content types to the three already added: *Film*, *Text*, *Video*.

On the frontend website, the tags and content types show up in the Library, as a *Filter* option.


## About/Footer

This is where you edit the *About* and *Footer* (displayed at the bottom of each page of the frontend website) texts. The footer is limited to short text and logo, but the About post has space for images aswell.

## Authors

### Author list
Every RASL Publications author has their own [page](https://publications.rasl.nu/authors) on the website. You add them to the list here. By default, the authors are listed alphabetically by surname. To change this, go to **Re-order**. You change the order the authors appear in on the website by dragging and dropping their names.

### Adding authors to post
If you go back to a post, you see the *Author* box in the bottom right corner. Simply select a name from the left table to add their name to a post. You can select multiple authors. Again, you can change the order in which they appear onkine by dragging and dropping the names in the right table.

## Media
'Media' is the library of images and other uploads to the site. You can add a new image simply by dragging it over the interface or by clicking **Add New**. The images can be organized as you wish by using the *Folders* system on the left â€” again by dragging and dropping images in the correct folders.

## Users
In this tab you get an overview of all the users and their roles. For now, you can make new user logins for editors. *Editors* are allowed to make (and remove) posts, change featured posts and update the *About*, *Author* and *Footer* pages.

# Tips
Quick list of things to keep in mind:

### Images and uploads
 - Featured images should have a minimum width of 1600 pixels.
 
### Inside a post
 - Make sure each post has an *Author*.
 - *Abstracts* are optional, but cannot extend over 350 characters.
 -  Long text with images? Add the text first, then find the right places for your images.
