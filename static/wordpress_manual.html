<h1 id="rasl-publications-wp-manual">RASL Publications WP Manual</h1>
<p>This is a short manual for the RASL Publications CMS - a version of Wordpress. Meant for editors. :)</p>
<h1 id="menu">Menu</h1>
<p>We'll quickly get into each item of the Wordpress menu. For more detailed help on filling in a post, see the below <a href="video">video's</a>.</p>
<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>
<p>On the frontend website, <em>Featured Posts</em> show up in the slideshow. They always require a featured image. Featured posts are actually selected from the three other categories of posts, to create a post go there:</p>
<ul>
<li>General/Intros</li>
<li>Practice</li>
<li>Reflective</li>
</ul>
<p>Then return to 'Featured' and simply select your post from the drop-down menu and click <strong>Publish</strong>. The post will now be featured on the front page.</p>
<h2 id="generalintros">General/Intros</h2>
<p>These are posts (articles, videos, podcasts) that cannot be defined by Practice or Reflective. They will not be shown on the website, unless also selected under 'Featured'.</p>
<p>See the next tab 'Practice and Reflective' for more info on creating a post.</p>
<h2 id="practice-and-reflective">Practice and Reflective</h2>
<p>We've seperated 'Practice' and 'Reflective' into two menu items, but the tabs are otherwise identical. This is where you add a new post (<strong>Add New</strong>), delete a post (mouse-over and select <strong>Trash</strong>) or edit a post (mouse-over and select <strong>Edit</strong>).</p>
<p>Inside a new post, the column on the right side gives you more options: this is where you change the status of the post (from <em>Draft</em> to <em>Published</em> for example), add tags and content types and select the authors.</p>
<p>For more help on adding content to a post, see the below video:</p>

</iframe>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>Inside a post, you can add a tag simply by typing it in the text field and clicking <strong>Add</strong>. It's important to be consistent in spelling and style. The CMS will also make a suggestion based on 'most used'.</p>
<p>The menu on the left side has a 'Tags' tab, where you have an overview of all the tags in use. This is also where you can edit the names, add descriptions or even <strong>Add</strong> a new one. The overview takes into account all posts, not just Reflective or Practice.</p>
<h3 id="content-types">Content Types</h3>
<p>Works just as the tags, although we would restrict the content types to the three already added: <em>Film</em>, <em>Text</em>, <em>Video</em>.</p>
<p>On the frontend website, the tags and content types show up in the Library, as a <em>Filter</em> option.</p>
<h2 id="aboutfooter">About/Footer</h2>
<p>This is where you edit the <em>About</em> and <em>Footer</em> (displayed at the bottom of each page of the frontend website) texts. The footer is limited to short text and logo, but the About post has space for images aswell.</p>
<h2 id="authors">Authors</h2>
<h3 id="author-list">Author list</h3>
<p>Every RASL Publications author has their own <a href="https://publications.rasl.nu/authors">page</a> on the website. You add them to the list here. By default, the authors are listed alphabetically by surname. To change this, go to <strong>Re-order</strong>. You change the order the authors appear in on the website by dragging and dropping their names.</p>
<h3 id="adding-authors-to-post">Adding authors to post</h3>
<p>If you go back to a post, you see the <em>Author</em> box in the bottom right corner. Simply select a name from the left table to add their name to a post. You can select multiple authors. Again, you can change the order in which they appear onkine by dragging and dropping the names in the right table.</p>
<h2 id="media">Media</h2>
<p>'Media' is the library of images and other uploads to the site. You can add a new image simply by dragging it over the interface or by clicking <strong>Add New</strong>. The images can be organized as you wish by using the <em>Folders</em> system on the left â€” again by dragging and dropping images in the correct folders.</p>
<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>In this tab you get an overview of all the users and their roles. For now, you can make new user logins for editors. <em>Editors</em> are allowed to make (and remove) posts, change featured posts and update the <em>About</em>, <em>Author</em> and <em>Footer</em> pages.</p>
<h1 id="tips">Tips</h1>
<p>Quick list of things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3 id="images-and-uploads">Images and uploads</h3>
<ul>
<li>Featured images should have a minimum width of 1600 pixels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inside-a-post">Inside a post</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure each post has an <em>Author</em>.</li>
<li><em>Abstracts</em> are optional, but cannot extend over 350 characters.</li>
<li>Long text with images? Add the text first, then find the right places for your images.</li>
</ul>
